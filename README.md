pythonRPG
=========

This RPG will be a long-term project, growing in complexity and scale.

As of yet, you require no modules that are not included  here or in the Python Standard Library.

Eventually I would like to migrate the game over to C++, and make it an open source Ogre3D project. In the mean time, it will be written in pure Python.

Please note:

This is mainly a programming excercise for me. If you want to fork, be my guest. It is likely well below the level most programmers on here are at.

That said, if you want to try it out, please feel free to do so! Let me know what you think of it! Make suggestions! Critique it to shreds. Suggest optimizations (in Python. . .ha), request features, whatever. This is my project, but a game isn't truly a game until it has been played by someone other than its creator.
