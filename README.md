pythonRPG
=========

This RPG will be a long-term project, growing in complexity and scale.

As of yet, you require no modules that are not included  here or in the Python Standard Library.

Eventually I would like to migrate the game over to C++, and make it an open source Ogre3D project. In the mean time,
it will be written in pure Python.

Please note:

This is mainly a programming excercise for me. If you want to fork, be my guest. It is likely well below the level most programmers on here are at.
