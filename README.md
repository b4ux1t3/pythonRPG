pythonRPG
=========

This RPG will be a long-term project, growing in complexity and scale. It is intended for the Raspberry Pi, but should be playable on any system running Python 2.7.8. Eventually I want to add Python GPIO input and out put and make it a Raspberry Pi exclusive, complete with a DIY, GPIO-powered controller. in the mean time, it's just a simple text-based RPG coded purely in Python.

As of yet, you require no modules that are not included here or in the Python Standard Library.

Please note:

This is mainly a programming excercise for me. If you want to fork, be my guest. It is likely well below the level most programmers on here are at.

That said, if you want to try it out, please feel free to do so! Let me know what you think of it! Make suggestions! Critique it to shreds. Suggest optimizations (in Python. . .ha), request features, whatever. This is my project, but a game isn't truly a game until it has been played by someone other than its creator.
