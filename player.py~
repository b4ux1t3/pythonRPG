The player object and all its uniqueness (i.e. none) reside here.

This game is designed to have as little difference between how units behave as possible. As such, every unit in the game, from the player to the goblin king, has the same basic structure. The only difference in the player's case is that it is controllable. The player has no uniqe attacks or abilities, and can even be any of the races in the game.

For now, though, the player is limited to goblin.

TODO:
    - Implement player race selection
